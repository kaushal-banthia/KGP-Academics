There is 1 folder and 1 file here besides this readme file.

Folder: Circuit Diagrams (Contains the circuit diagrams as .png and .cddx files, made by https://www.circuit-diagram.org/editor/)

File: Expt_3_19CS10039_Kaushal (Lab Report as a word (.docx) file)

NOTE: There are some circuit diagrams that are from Falstad and hence they do not have any .cddx files. 
      Rather they have a .txt file and a .png file. The .txt file can be used to recreate the circuit in Falstad
	
      Also, there are some circuit diagrams that have been taken from VLabs, by means of a screenshot,
      and thus do not have either a .cddx file, or a .txt file. They are only present as .jpg images.
