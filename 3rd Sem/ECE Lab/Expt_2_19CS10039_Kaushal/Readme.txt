There are 2 folders here and 1 file here besides this readme file.

Folders: Circuit Diagrams (Contains the circuit diagrams as .png and .cddx files, made by https://www.circuit-diagram.org/editor/)
	 Graphs (Contains the Graphs as .png files, made by the Matplotlib Library in Python)

File: Expt_2_19CS10039_Kaushal (Lab Report as a word (.docx) file)

NOTE: There are two circuit diagrams that are from Falstad and hence they do not have any .cddx files. 
      Rather they have a .txt file and a .png file. The .txt file can be used to recreate the circuit in Falstad
