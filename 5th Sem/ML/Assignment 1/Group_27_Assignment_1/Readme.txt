To run the file, either:
1. Use Google Colab and open the link provided in the report. (**Preferred**)
2. Use the attached file and run it in jupyter notebook

1. When opening the file in Google Colab, all you need to do to execute the code is run each cell in the file (except the force prune cells).
This can be done by clicking on the run button, or shift + enter for each cell.
**NOTE**: One important thing that needs to be done is, uploading the attached Indian Liver Patient Dataset (ILPD) csv file to the Google Colab runtime.
This should be added in the folder named 'content' (the folder that contains 'sample_data') (the one that shows up when clicking the file button on the 
left bar in Google Colab).

2. If the file is run in Jupyter Notebook, then a few libraries and softwares would have to be installed first (if they aren't already installed yet)
This can be done using the following pip commands (It is assumed that the user has pip and Python 3 installed on their system)

pip install notebook
pip install numpy
pip install pandas
pip install matplotlib
pip install seaborn
pip install sklearn
pip install graphviz

After this run the following command to open Jupyter Notebook

jupyter notebook

Once the notebook opens in a browser, locate the file and open it. The remaining procedure would be similar to Google Colab.
All you need to do to execute the code is run each cell in the file (except the force prune cells).
This can be done by clicking shift + enter for each cell.
